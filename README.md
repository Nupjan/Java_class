## üß† Why Java and OOP?

Java is one of the most widely used programming languages, and its Object-Oriented Programming paradigm is a cornerstone of modern software development. By learning Java and OOP, I aim to:
- Understand the principles of clean, modular, and reusable code.
- Build a strong foundation for learning other programming languages and frameworks.
- Develop problem-solving skills and a structured approach to programming.
